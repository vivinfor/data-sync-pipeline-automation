# DataSync & Pipeline Automation

**DataSync & Pipeline Automation** is a cutting-edge solution for building, managing, and visualizing data pipelines. Tailored for modern business demands and technical leaders like CTOs and directors, it leverages technologies such as **Django** and **Plotly** to create a robust system capable of processing, transforming, and analyzing large data volumes with ease.

A standout feature of this project is its complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline, powered by **PostgreSQL**, **Pandas**, and **Requests**. This system extracts data directly from the **Azure DevOps API**, performs advanced transformations, and loads structured data into a centralized database. It also includes dynamic dashboards built with **Plotly**, offering interactive insights and detailed analytics. Best practices in modularity, security, and code organization ensure a scalable and reliable platform.

## Architecture and Technologies

The project employs a scalable architecture that integrates multiple technologies for seamless end-to-end data management and visualization:

### Data Pipeline:
- **Azure DevOps API**: Extracts real-time data from repositories, work items, and project metrics.
- **PostgreSQL**: Serves as a centralized database for structured data.
- **Pandas**: Performs streamlined data transformations.
- **Requests**: Handles API integration for fetching and posting data.

### Visualization:
- **Plotly**: Creates interactive dashboards showcasing KPIs like backlog analysis, rework proportion, and delivery trends.
- **Django Templates**: Renders a user-friendly interface.

### Application Framework:
- **Django**: Handles user authentication, permission management, and core backend operations.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent development and production environments.

## Key Features

- **Backlog Analysis**: Gain insights into the current state of work items across types.
- **Rework Proportion**: Highlights error-related backlogs, helping identify inefficiencies.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualize KPIs dynamically with Plotly.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets and complex workflows.
